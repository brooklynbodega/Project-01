Game Description: This game will have a landing page asking for the player's name and introduces the rules for play: Click all the color-changing cells so they match before the countdown clock runs out. Upon input, the player will be redirected to the level one page:

Level One: There will be six (6) blinking cells changing color at a quick pace. The player will click on any of the cells to stop the change in color and must match all other cells to that color within the timeframe allotted. Once a cell is clicked, it will not change color again. Once all cells are of the same color, the player will be prompted with a winning message and move onto level two.

Level Two: Similar to level one, there will be nine (9) blinking cells, with more colors and changing color at a faster pace. Once all cells are matching, the player will be displayed with a winning message and move onto the final stage.

Level Three: In Level Three, the cells will be moving across the web page. Upon getting all tiles to match the same color, the player will be displayed their final winning message.

Technologies used:
"	- HTML
"	  - <divs>, #ids, and .classes
"	- CSS
"	  - Animation keyframes, CSS Grid styling, :hover, and perhaps :after
"	- jQuery
    - Functinos, event handlers, if statements

Potential Issues: Finding a function or CSS property to best implement the changing color scheme will be a small but familiar issue. Having the design to look as sleek as I envision will be a personal struggle. Larger struggles will be finding a countdown timer & resetting the board. For the final level, having the cells move while rapidly changing color and not being static once clicked will prove to be a tough function/loop/method to figure out.

Solution Planning: Rather than run into my usual planning of thinking too far ahead, I plan to start simple and build from there. I won't work on any nice styling until I have my functions working. This game is essentially a mash-up of two games I was unable to complete/did not understand how to complete previously, Tic Tac Toe & Duck Hunt, plus an added timer. I'm excited to approach old challenges with new knowledge and implementing them. Sticking to a functional approach and "rubberducking" instead of heading straight for the destination will allow me the space to work out any kinks.
